# TileJSON

A `vector`, `raster` or `raster-dem` [source](sources.md) can point at a [TileJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec/tree/master/3.0.0) document with its `url` property instead of listing its tiles in the style. MapLibre loads the document and reads the keys below from it. A key set on the source in the style takes precedence over the same key in the TileJSON.

| Key | Read from the TileJSON for |
| --- | --- |
| `tiles` | The tile URL templates. |
| `minzoom`, `maxzoom` | The zoom range the source has tiles for. |
| `bounds` | The area the source has tiles for; no tiles are requested outside it. |
| `attribution` | The attribution shown for the source. |
| `scheme` | The tile coordinate scheme, `xyz` or `tms`. |
| `vector_layers` | The ids of the layers in a vector source, which a layer's `source-layer` is checked against. |
| `tileSize` | The tile size in pixels of a `raster` or `raster-dem` source. |
| `encoding` | The encoding of the tiles: `terrarium`, `mapbox` or `custom` for `raster-dem`, `mvt` or `mlt` for `vector`. |
| `emptyTileBehavior` | How a tile response with an empty body is handled, see below. |

The first six are part of TileJSON 3.0.0. The last three are MapLibre's additions. TileJSON 3.0.0 asks implementations to treat keys they do not know as absent, so a TileJSON that carries them stays valid for other clients.

## emptyTileBehavior

A tile server with partial coverage has two ways to say that it has no tile at a place: a 404 response, which makes the tile missing so that a loaded tile from another zoom level shows through, or an empty response (HTTP 204, or 200 with no content), which loads as an empty tile that draws nothing. Whether an empty tile means "nothing here" or "not generated at this zoom" is a property of the tileset, so the TileJSON can say so once, for every style that uses it:

```json
{
  "tilejson": "3.0.0",
  "tiles": ["https://tiles.example.com/terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}.webp"],
  "minzoom": 0,
  "maxzoom": 12,
  "emptyTileBehavior": "missing"
}
```

The values are those of the source property of the same name, documented for each source type in [sources](sources.md):

- `transparent` (default): an empty response loads as an empty tile, with nothing to draw for `vector` and `raster` sources and no elevation for `raster-dem`.
- `missing`: an empty response is treated like a 404, and a loaded tile from another zoom level shows through. For `vector` sources a 404 response is treated the same way.

A style that sets the property on the source overrides the TileJSON:

```json
"terrain": {
  "type": "raster-dem",
  "url": "https://tiles.example.com/terrain.json",
  "emptyTileBehavior": "transparent"
}
```
